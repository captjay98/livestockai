# Farmer Guide - Managing Extension Worker Access

## Overview

As a farmer, you control who can view your farm data. Extension workers (government agents, NGO staff) can request access to help monitor your farm health and provide advisory services. This guide explains how to manage these access requests.

## Viewing Access Requests

### Where to Find Requests

1. Navigate to your farm detail page
2. Scroll to the "Access Requests" card
3. You'll see two sections:
   - **Pending Requests** - Awaiting your decision
   - **Active Grants** - Currently approved access

### Understanding a Request

Each request shows:

- **Requester Name & Email** - Who is asking for access
- **Purpose** - Why they need access (e.g., "Routine health inspection")
- **Duration** - How long they want access (default: 90 days)
- **Request Date** - When they submitted the request

## Approving Access

### Step-by-Step

1. Click **"Approve"** on the pending request
2. A dialog appears with options:
   - **Financial Visibility** - Toggle on/off (default: off)
   - **Duration Override** - Change the number of days (optional)
3. Review your choices
4. Click **"Confirm Approval"**

### What They Can See

**Always Visible:**

- Farm name and location
- Batch information (species, quantity, age)
- Mortality records
- Health status and trends
- Visit history

**Optional (Financial Visibility):**

- Feed costs
- Sales revenue
- Expenses
- Profit/loss data

**Recommendation**: Only grant financial visibility if required for loan applications or government programs.

## Denying Access

### When to Deny

- You don't recognize the requester
- The purpose is unclear or suspicious
- You don't want external monitoring at this time
- You're already working with another extension service

### How to Deny

1. Click **"Deny"** on the pending request
2. Optionally provide a reason (helps them understand)
3. Click **"Confirm Denial"**

The requester will be notified of your decision.

## Managing Active Grants

### Viewing Active Access

The "Active Grants" section shows:

- Agent name and email
- Granted date
- Expiration date
- Financial visibility status (Yes/No)

### Revoking Access

You can revoke access at any time:

1. Click **"Revoke"** on the active grant
2. Optionally provide a reason
3. Click **"Confirm Revocation"**

**Effect**: Immediate - the extension worker loses access instantly. Both parties receive a notification.

### When Access Expires

- You'll receive a warning 7 days before expiry
- Access automatically ends on the expiration date
- The extension worker can request renewal if needed

## Viewing Visit Records

### What are Visit Records?

When an extension worker visits your farm, they create a digital record with:

- Visit date and type (routine/emergency/follow-up)
- Findings (what they observed)
- Recommendations (what you should do)
- Attachments (photos, documents)
- Follow-up date (if applicable)

### Where to Find Visits

1. Navigate to your farm detail page
2. Scroll to the "Extension Worker Visits" card
3. Visits are listed newest first

### Understanding Visit Status

- 🔴 **Unacknowledged** - You haven't reviewed this visit yet
- ✓ **Acknowledged** - You've marked this as reviewed

### Acknowledging a Visit

1. Read the findings and recommendations
2. Click **"Acknowledge"** (one-time action)
3. The visit is marked as reviewed

**Why acknowledge?** It helps extension workers know you've seen their recommendations.

### Viewing Visit Details

Click **"View Details"** to see:

- Full findings and recommendations
- All attachments (click to download)
- Follow-up date
- Agent contact information

You can also print the visit record for your files.

## Notifications

You'll receive notifications for:

- New access requests
- New visit records
- Access expiry warnings (7 days before)
- Access revocations

Check the notification bell icon in the top right corner.

## Privacy & Security

### Your Data is Protected

- Extension workers only see what you approve
- Financial data is hidden by default
- You can revoke access at any time
- All actions are logged for accountability

### Who Can Request Access?

Only users assigned to your district by system admins can request access. This ensures only legitimate extension workers can see your farm.

### Audit Trail

All access-related actions are logged:

- Who requested access and when
- Your approval/denial decisions
- When access was granted or revoked
- Who viewed your farm data

Admins can review these logs if needed.

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do

- Review the purpose before approving
- Only grant financial visibility when necessary
- Acknowledge visit records promptly
- Revoke access if you're no longer working with that agent
- Keep your contact information up to date

### ❌ Don't

- Approve requests from unknown people
- Grant financial visibility by default
- Ignore visit recommendations
- Let expired access auto-renew without review

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I approve a request for less than the requested duration?

**A:** Yes! When approving, you can override the duration to any number of days.

### Q: What happens if I deny a request?

**A:** The extension worker is notified and can submit a new request with more details if needed.

### Q: Can I see who viewed my farm data?

**A:** Yes, audit logs track all access. Contact your admin to review logs.

### Q: How do I know if an extension worker is legitimate?

**A:** Only users assigned to your district by system admins can request access. If you're unsure, contact your local agricultural office.

### Q: Can I revoke access and then re-grant it later?

**A:** Yes, the extension worker can submit a new access request after revocation.

### Q: What if I accidentally approved the wrong request?

**A:** Immediately revoke the access grant. The extension worker loses access instantly.

### Q: Do visit records disappear when I revoke access?

**A:** No, visit records remain visible to you. They're part of your farm history.

### Q: Can extension workers edit visit records?

**A:** Only within 24 hours of creation. After that, records are locked.

### I approved a request but they still can't access my farm

- Ensure the extension worker is viewing the correct district
- Wait a few minutes for the system to sync

### I want to change financial visibility on an existing grant

- You must revoke the current grant
- The extension worker can submit a new request
- Approve with the desired financial visibility setting
