# Hackathon Demo Script: OpenLivestock Manager

**Target Duration**: 3:30 - 4:00 Minutes
**Goal**: Demonstrate how the Kiro CLI enabled a single developer to build a "production-grade" livestock OS in record time.

## 🕒 Video Timeline & Script

| Timestamp       | Visual Content                                            | Audio / Narrative Focus                                                                                                                                                              |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0:00 - 0:30** | Intro slide + quick mobile PWA screen.                    | **The Problem**: 2 billion people rely on livestock, yet most are unbanked and offline. We built OpenLivestock to bring "Agentic Intelligence" to the edge.                          |
| **0:30 - 1:00** | Dashboard demo (Stats, Charts).                           | **The Solution**: An offline-first PWA running on Cloudflare Workers. 6 species supported, 15 languages out of the box. Fully functional even deep in the field.                     |
| **1:00 - 1:45** | **The Kiro Workflow**: Open VS Code, show `.kiro/specs/`. | **The "Secret Sauce"**: We didn't just "prompt" this app. We used Kiro to orchestrate 9 specialized agents. Show a spec like `intelligent-forecasting.md` and how it maps to code.   |
| **1:45 - 2:30** | Screen recording of a Kiro interaction.                   | **Agentic Delegation**: Show how we delegated a complex task (e.g., mortality rate logic) to a `backend-specialist` agent using the `kit` command. Demonstrate the 75% time savings. |
| **2:30 - 3:00** | Code tour: Architecture & Tests.                          | **Production Quality**: Highlight the Three-Layer Architecture. Show the 302 automated tests and 60,000 assertions generated by the `qa-engineer` agent.                             |
| **3:00 - 3:30** | Final CTA + production URL.                               | **The Impact**: By combining Kiro's agentic power with robust engineering, we created a tool that gives unbanked farmers a "Credit Passport."                                        |

## 💡 What You Should Do (Production Tips)

### 1. The "Side-by-Side" Visual

- Split the screen: Show the **Spec file** on the left and the **Working UI/Feature** on the right.
- _Why_: This proves Kiro's direct impact on the final product.

### 2. Live Terminal (Overlay)

- Pop up a terminal window briefly showing `kiro task ...` or `kiro chat`.
- _Why_: Judges love seeing the tool _actually in use_ rather than just talking about it.

### 3. Show "Intelligence"

- Don't just show a CRUD form. Show the **Feed Formulation** or **Growth Projections**.
- _Explain_: "The agent analyzed the species' growth curve and implemented this projection logic in one pass."

### 4. Language Swap

- Switch the app from English to a local language (e.g., Swahili or French) mid-demo.
- _Why_: It highlights "Application Quality" and the ease of handling complexity with agents.

## 📑 Supporting Documents to Mention

- **AI-DEVELOPMENT-SUMMARY.md**: Mention this as the "blueprint" of how the app was built.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Reference for technical judges.
- **AGENTS.md**: Show the 9-agent orchestration layer.

## ✅ Checklist Before Recording

- [ ] Run `bun run db:seed:dev` to ensure rich dashboard data.
- [ ] Clear browser cache to show a fresh PWA installation.
- [ ] Set your IDE to a clean, readable font size.
- [ ] Record in 1080p, 60fps for maximum "Wow" factor.
