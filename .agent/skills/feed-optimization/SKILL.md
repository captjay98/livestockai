# Feed Optimization

Analyze and optimize feed usage for cost efficiency.

## When to Use

- High FCR batches
- Cost reduction initiatives
- Feed planning

## Key Metrics

- **FCR**: Feed Conversion Ratio
- **Feed Cost per Kg Gain**: Cost efficiency
- **Daily Feed Consumption**: Usage patterns

## Analysis Process

1. **Calculate current FCR**

   ```typescript
   const fcr = totalFeedKg / totalWeightGainKg
   ```

2. **Compare to benchmarks**
   | Species | Target FCR |
   |---------|------------|
   | Broiler | 1.6-1.8 |
   | Catfish | 1.2-1.5 |
   | Tilapia | 1.4-1.6 |

3. **Identify waste**
   - Feeding schedule efficiency
   - Feed storage issues
   - Overstocking effects

4. **Optimize**
   - Adjust feeding schedule
   - Review feed quality
   - Consider feed additives

## Recommendations Output

- Current vs target FCR
- Potential cost savings
- Specific actions to implement
