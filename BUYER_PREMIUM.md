## Buyer Registration Flow

### Current Problem

After registration, all users are forced into farmer onboarding (create farm, pick modules, etc.). Buyers don't need farms.

### Solution: User Type Selection

#### Step 1: Registration

```
/register
- Name
- Email
- Password
- [Register Button]
```

#### Step 2: User Type Selection (NEW)

```
"What brings you to LivestockAI?"

[🌾 I'm a Farmer]
- Manage my farm operations
- Track batches and records
- Sell livestock on marketplace
→ Redirect to farmer onboarding

[🛒 I'm a Buyer]
- Browse marketplace
- Purchase livestock
- Manage suppliers
→ Skip onboarding, go to /marketplace

[Skip for now]
→ Go to /marketplace (can set up farm later)
```

#### Implementation

```typescript
// After registration, show user type selection
POST /api/user/set-type
{
  userType: 'farmer' | 'buyer' | 'both'
}

// Store in user_settings table
user_settings: {
  userId: 'uuid',
  userType: 'buyer', // NEW FIELD
  onboardingCompleted: true, // Skip for buyers
  // ... other settings
}
```
